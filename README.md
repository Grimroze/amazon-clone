# amazon-clone
A responsive frontend clone of Amazon's website built with HTML and CSS. It replicates the homepage design, focusing on clean code, responsive layouts, and modern styling techniques like Flexbox and Media Queries. This project showcases my skills in web design and serves as a foundation for adding interactivity and backend features.
